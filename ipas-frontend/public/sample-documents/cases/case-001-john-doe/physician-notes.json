Associated symptoms include nausea, photophobia, and occasional dizziness. No fever, neck stiffness, or focal neurological symptoms. No recent head trauma or travel history. OTC medications have provided no relief.",

MRI brain with contrast is medically necessary to rule out intracranial pathology including mass lesions, vascular abnormalities, or acute stroke. Clinical guidelines support MRI imaging for persistent headaches with associated symptoms."
